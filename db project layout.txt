Blueprint Ver 7/17/2024 @ 12:43 AM

Use Case:
	Initially a small app intended for one or a few users, ideally scalable to online remote access
	to DB server and taking several hundred queries a day. Maps frontline/combat positions given GPS
	coordinates, date, description box for sources, and supports an attachable displayed picture.
	Order of operations and possibly an 'export' to GIS should be implented.
	
	Framework ideas:
	- SCS island control table with GIS embedded map with dredging expansion
	- Car cost calculator

NOTES:
	- MS SQL Server can run on Linux
	- MS Access cannot run natively on Linux

Hardware:
	- Raspberry Pi 4? (likely too slow)
	- ALT: A dedicated Windows compact/low power server PC
	
Backend:
	- MS SQL Server
	- pyodbc SQL driver for Python
	
Frontend:
	- (initial) tkinter/PyQt
	- (later) MS Access
